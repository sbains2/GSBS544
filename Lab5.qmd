- Age of primary beneficiary

- Gender of primary beneficiary (only female, male recorded)

- Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

- Whether the beneficiary smokes

- The beneficiaryâ€™s residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

- Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

Read in the dataset, and display some summaries of the data.
